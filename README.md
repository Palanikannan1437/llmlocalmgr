_"The performance optimized LLM weights manager that keeps the world green"_

It is no secret with anyone seriously experimenting with today's LLMs.   The repeated world-wide-wait for 100s of GBs of LLM weights to download from huggingface or github is a source of global warming and universal users frustration.

This simple utility beautifully manages the LLMs (weights) that are meaningful to you (your configurations) and serve it to your servers and appliatiions at your home network's native speed (GE or 10GE typically).  It is designed to work  well with today's fast NvME drives and Thuderbolt3/4 interconnects.
